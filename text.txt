Seba CJ2 are based around concept of a boot with integrated padding. This brings benefits of reduced weight and increased precision of following your movements by skate. While CJ Carbon are made, as name suggests, with carbon fibre shell, CJ 2 uses a composite material equivalent. As a result, skate is a bit heavier than its more high end counterpart, but also a bit more flexible. This makes the skate feeling less rigid out of the box and will appeal to skaters who prefer a bit more ankle freedom as well as skates that bend more on tricks. It’s worth to note that while CJ 2 are still a nice boot for custom setups with big wheels, they won’t offer the same level of energy transfer efficiency as carbon made ones. If you are after a boot to attach your Wizard frames to – CJ Carbon are still the top choice. On the plus side – composite shell means that skate costs less overall.
